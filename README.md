# Email-Spam-Detection

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: We have developed a machine learning model that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and various classification techniques to classify emails.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset used for training and testing the model has undergone rigorous preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering.

- **Performance Metrics**: The project evaluates the model's performance using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Easy Integration**: You can seamlessly integrate the email spam detection model into your email client or system to enhance your email filtering capabilities.

- **Customization**: The model can be fine-tuned to adapt to specific needs, allowing users to customize and optimize spam detection rules.
